# **Welcome to the Wumpus Game**

The game is pretty simple, go into the Wumpus cave, grab as much gold as you can, and get out.
Sounds simple and quick... *right*?
Well, theres a catch, or more. Firstly, Wumpus is resting in the cave somewhere, ready to eat anyone
who dares get too close. Secondly, there are a few seemingly bottomless pits scattered around that
might just keep you from your precious gold. Oh, and I'm not giving you a torch to light your path,
so I hope youre good at remembering the path youve walked. Are you ready to brave the game?

## **Before Entering the Cave:**

Each player starts with a baseline of 300 gold pieces.

Each player starts with a baseline of 3 javelins.

Before entering the cave, the player has the option to buy a javelin for 100 gold pieces.

## **Player Movement and Actions:**

The player has 4 movement options, Up, Down, Left, and Right.

At any point the player can choose to shoot a javelin Up, Down, Left, or Right.
   If the player shoots a javelin, the javelin will continue moving unless it hits a wall, or Wumpus.
   If the javelin hits Wumpus, you will hear a scream as Wumpus dies.

If the player moves to the position Wumpus is in, the player will die as Wumpus gobbles them up.

If the player moves to the position a pit is in, the player will plummet to their death.

If the player moves to the position some gold is in, the player has the option to pick up a piece.

## **Wumpus, Pit, and Gold Hints:**

If the player is in a position that is adjacent to Wumpus, they will smell a terrible stench.

If the player is in a position that is adjacent to a pit, they will feel a bit of a breeze.

If the player is in a position that has at least one gold piece, they will see some golden specks.

## **After Leaving the Cave:**

Once the player goes back to the position where they began, they have three options. The player
can choose to take their gold and leave, continue to search the cave for more gold, or go to a
lower level cave to try and find more riches. Let it be known, each level down will have twice
as much gold as the previous level.
